# Codeglish 🐒
A communication language only for die-hard programmers. Try Codeglish on internet chat platforms for fun. But, please don't use Codeglish in task management platforms where you need to have a professional profile.

What you say now.
```
Hi.. 
I've pushed the code into GitHub. But I'm not sure whether it contains bugs.
```

What you'll say after practicing Codeglish.

```
mans
I've pushed the code into github.exe. !sure bugs.exist
```

Enjoy!

## 0. Basics

- If there is a noun/verb that needs to be highlighted, the ending can be `.exe` (or your favorite file extension). Eg: I've pushed the changes to github.exe
- Every chat initiates with `thug`, `mans` or `hey`.
- Don't use thumbs-up emoji/reaction. Instead, use 🐒 (Dancing monkey)
- Don't use `not` word. Instead, use `!` right before the next word. Eg: !sure

## 7. Advanced concepts

- Actions and tasks can be represented as code snippets (In your favorite programming language).
  Eg: If you need to say that you found a nice movie, you can use `noiceMovies.push('<movie name>')`
- Problems and rejections can be represented as Exceptions.
  Eg: A: Let's go for a tea. B: `throw new IHaveToFindABugException()`
- You can use Linux commands-like things as well. 
  Eg: If you need to say "Forget this problem", you can say `this pipe /dev/null`
